## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Outline the prerequisites needed to work with this project, such as specific tools or dependencies.]

- Access to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an online Solidity IDE.
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for deploying the contract.

### Executing the Program

1. **Open Remix:**
   - Go to the [Remix website](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File:**
   - Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `YourContractName.sol`).

3. **Copy and Paste the Code:**
   - Paste the Solidity code for your contract into the newly created file.

   ```solidity
   // Example Solidity Code
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract YourContractName {
       // Contract code here
   }
## Compile the Contract:

In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, ensure the compiler version is set to a compatible version (e.g., ^0.8.0).
Click "Compile YourContractName.sol".
Deploy the Contract:

## Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Select your contract from the contract dropdown menu and click "Deploy".
